# Email-Spam-Classifier-using-Support-Vector-Machines
An Email Spam Classifier created using Support Vector Machines and Stemming Software

--> This is a course-type project, in which I have created an email spam classifier. The classifying algorithm consists of a combination of support vector machines and other related optimization algorithms.
--> Features used were common words that one can find in a general spam email. All words were stripped down to their stems (by virtue of reduction of derivational and lexical morphemes) using stemming software.
